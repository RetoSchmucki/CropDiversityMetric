## Spatiotemporal crop diversity in agricultural rotation landscapes

This repository contains the conceptual framework and the method used to calculate the spatial and temporal components of crop diversity in agricultural landscapes, using Individual-Based Rarefaction curves computed along both of the dimensions that characterise the short-term dynamics of agricultural landscapes shaped by arable crops.

We provide the necessary functions to compute the different components of crop diversity and test the adequacy of extrapolating crop diversity beyond the length of the sequence available. This concept has been shown for biological diversity in species communities, but need to be validated for crop sequence sown in rotation cropping systems.

The text and R-code is available in the [RMarkdown file (.Rmd)](https://github.com/RetoSchmucki/CropDiversityMetric/blob/main/SpatiotemporalCropDiversity.Rmd) and the full compiled version in the [PDF file](https://github.com/RetoSchmucki/CropDiversityMetric/blob/main/SpatiotemporalCropDiversity.pdf).

This method has been used to compute the spatialtemporal component of arable crop grown in Denmark, England and France and presented in Bohan et al. (2021).
